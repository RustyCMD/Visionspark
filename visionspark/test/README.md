- `VSLoadingIndicator` (with and without messages)
- `VSEmptyState` (with all elements)
- `VSResponsiveText` (with scaling)
- `VSResponsiveSpacing` (layout spacing)
- `VSResponsiveLayout` (content constraints)
- `VSResponsiveBuilder` (breakpoint handling)

### â™¿ Accessibility Tests (`accessibility/accessibility_test.dart`)
Comprehensive accessibility validation including:
- Color contrast ratio calculations and validation
- Touch target size requirements
- Semantic label generation
- Screen reader compatibility
- Focus management
- Keyboard navigation
- WCAG compliance testing

**Key Features Tested:**
- `VSAccessibility` utility functions
- `VSAccessibilityTesting` validation tools
- Accessible widget implementations
- Semantic properties and labels
- Touch target size compliance
- Focus management functionality

### ðŸ”— Integration Tests (`integration/screen_integration_test.dart`)
End-to-end testing of complete screens and user workflows:
- `ResponsiveTestScreen` functionality
- `AccessibilityTestScreen` features
- Component integration and interaction
- Error handling and edge cases
- Theme integration
- Cross-component compatibility

**Screens Tested:**
- Responsive test screen with all breakpoint features
- Accessibility test screen with all validation tools
- Design system component combinations
- Error states and edge cases

### âš¡ Performance Tests (`performance/performance_test.dart`)
Performance benchmarks and optimization validation:
- Component rendering speed
- Memory usage and leak detection
- Animation performance
- Large dataset handling
- Responsive layout efficiency
- Widget tree optimization

**Performance Metrics:**
- Rendering time benchmarks
- Memory leak detection
- Animation smoothness
- Large list performance
- Responsive rebuild efficiency

## Test Quality Standards

### Code Coverage
- Minimum 90% line coverage for design system components
- 100% coverage for accessibility utilities
- Integration test coverage for all major user flows
- Performance benchmarks for all interactive components

### Accessibility Compliance
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for all components
- Screen reader compatibility testing
- Keyboard navigation validation
- Color contrast ratio verification
- Touch target size validation

### Performance Requirements
- Initial render time < 100ms for simple components
- Complex component render time < 300ms
- Large dataset handling < 500ms
- Memory usage optimization
- Smooth animations at 60fps

## Continuous Integration

These tests are designed to run in CI/CD pipelines to ensure:
- All UI/UX improvements maintain quality standards
- Accessibility requirements are continuously validated
- Performance regressions are caught early
- Design system consistency is maintained

## Test Maintenance

### Adding New Tests
1. Create test files in appropriate category directories
2. Follow existing naming conventions
3. Include comprehensive test coverage
4. Update this README with new test information
5. Add imports to `test_runner.dart`

### Updating Existing Tests
1. Maintain backward compatibility
2. Update performance benchmarks as needed
3. Ensure accessibility standards remain current
4. Keep integration tests synchronized with UI changes

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Import errors**: Ensure all test files are properly imported in `test_runner.dart`
- **Widget not found**: Check that widgets are properly wrapped in `MaterialApp`
- **Async issues**: Use `await tester.pumpAndSettle()` for animations
- **Performance failures**: Adjust benchmarks based on test environment

### Debug Mode
Run tests with verbose output:
```bash
flutter test --verbose test/test_runner.dart
```

### Test Coverage Report
Generate coverage report:
```bash
flutter test --coverage
genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/html
```
