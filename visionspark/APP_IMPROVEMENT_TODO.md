## ðŸš€ Quality of Life (QOL) Improvements

- [ ] **Minimize Widget Rebuilds** _(Easy)_
  - Use `const` constructors and avoid unnecessary logic in `build()` methods.
- [ ] **Reduce App Size** _(Easy)_
  - Use deferred loading/code splitting and `flutter build apk --split-per-abi`.
- [ ] **Monitor Performance** _(Easy)_
  - Integrate analytics and crash reporting (e.g., Firebase Crashlytics, Sentry).
- [ ] **Improve Error Handling** _(Medium)_
  - Use robust error boundaries and user-friendly error messages.
- [ ] **Accessibility Enhancements** _(Medium)_
  - Ensure screen reader support, semantic labels, and keyboard navigation.
- [ ] **Automate Testing** _(Medium)_
  - Add unit, widget, and integration tests. Use CI/CD for automated checks.
- [ ] **Optimize Image Handling** _(Medium)_
  - Use image compression and caching (e.g., `cached_network_image`).
  - Prefer SVG/vector images for icons and backgrounds.
- [ ] **Implement Lazy Loading & Pagination** _(Medium)_
  - Use `ListView.builder` and pagination for large lists and feeds.
- [ ] **Improve Animation Smoothness** _(Medium)_
  - Use `AnimatedContainer`, `AnimatedOpacity`, and avoid heavy logic in animation callbacks.
- [ ] **Adopt Efficient State Management** _(Hard)_
  - Evaluate and implement Provider, Riverpod, or BLoC for scalable state handling.
- [ ] **Leverage Isolates for Heavy Computation** _(Hard)_
  - Offload CPU-intensive tasks (e.g., JSON parsing, image processing) to isolates.

- [ ] **Advanced Analytics** _(Medium)_
  - Track user journeys, feature usage, and retention metrics.
- [ ] **Administration Dashboard** _(Medium)_
  - Create local admin dashboard with action logging.
- [ ] **Monetization Features** _(Hard)_

- [ ] **Desktop & Web Support** _(Hard)_
  - Expand app to Windows, macOS, Linux, and web platforms.
- [ ] **AI/ML Features** _(Hard)_
  - Integrate TensorFlow Lite or ML Kit for smart features (e.g., image recognition).
- [ ] **Video Generation** _(Hard)_
  - Temporarily paused feature for future implementation.
