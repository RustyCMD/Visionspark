## üèóÔ∏è Project Architecture

Visionspark's codebase is thoughtfully organized into the Flutter front-end and the Supabase back-end.

### üì± `visionspark/lib` (Flutter/Dart Files)

This directory houses the core Flutter application logic and UI components, structured for modularity:

-   `auth/`: Screens and logic for user authentication.
-   `features/`: Distinct feature modules (account, gallery, image_generator, etc.).
-   `shared/`: Common widgets, utilities, and services.
-   `main.dart`: The application's entry point.

### üöÄ `supabase/` (Supabase Backend)

This folder contains all files to manage the Supabase backend:

-   `functions/`: TypeScript Edge Functions for server-side operations like AI image generation, account deletion, and gallery feeds.
-   `migrations/`: Version-controlled SQL scripts that define and evolve the database schema.
-   `config.toml`: Configuration for the Supabase CLI.
-   `SECURITY_GUIDANCE.md`: Important security best practices.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run Visionspark locally.

### Prerequisites

-   **Flutter SDK**: Latest stable release recommended.
-   **Dart SDK**: Bundled with Flutter.
-   **Supabase CLI**: For managing the backend.
-   **Node.js & npm**: For Supabase Edge Functions development.
-   An active **Supabase account**.

### Setup Guide

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/RustyCMD/Visionspark.git
    cd Visionspark
    ```

2.  **Set up Your Supabase Project**:
    -   Create a new project on [Supabase.com](https://supabase.com).
    -   Retrieve your **Project URL** and **Anon Key**.
    -   Configure these **Environment Variables** in your Supabase project dashboard (Project Settings > Edge Functions):
        -   `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`: Found in your project's API Settings.
        -   `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key.
        -   `DISCORD_WEBHOOK`: Your Discord webhook URL for support messages.

3.  **Configure the Flutter Application**:
    -   Navigate to the Flutter app directory:
        ```bash
        cd visionspark
        ```
    -   Create a `.env` file (`visionspark/.env`) and add your credentials:
        ```
        SUPABASE_URL=YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL
        SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
        ```
    -   **Security Note**: Ensure `.env` is listed in your root `.gitignore`.

4.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

5.  **Set up Local Supabase Environment**:
    -   Navigate to the Supabase directory:
        ```bash
        cd ../supabase
        ```
    -   Log in and link your project:
        ```bash
        supabase login
        supabase link --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_REF
        ```
    -   To run services locally:
        ```bash
        supabase start
        ```

6.  **Deploy Supabase Migrations & Functions**:
    -   Push database migrations:
        ```bash
        supabase db push
        ```
    -   Deploy Edge Functions:
        ```bash
        # Deploy specific functions
        supabase functions deploy --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_REF [FUNCTION_NAME]

        # Or deploy all functions
        supabase functions deploy --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_REF --all
        ```

7.  **Run the Flutter App**:
    -   Return to the Flutter app directory:
        ```bash
        cd ../visionspark
        ```
    -   Launch the app:
        ```bash
        flutter run
        ```

## üõ†Ô∏è Supabase Backend Deep Dive

The Supabase backend powers Visionspark's data, authentication, and serverless logic.

-   **Edge Functions**: Low-latency TypeScript functions handling critical operations. Ensure all required environment variables (`SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `DISCORD_WEBHOOK`) are correctly set.
-   **Database Migrations**: Version-controlled SQL scripts in `supabase/migrations/` define the database schema, including tables, triggers, and functions to maintain data integrity.
