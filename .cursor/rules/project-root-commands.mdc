# Project Root Command Rule

**All commands related to building, running, or managing the Flutter app must be executed from the project root directory:**

```
E:/Visionspark/visionspark
```

This directory contains the `pubspec.yaml` and is the root for all Flutter operations. Running commands from any other directory (such as `E:/Visionspark`) will result in errors like "No pubspec.yaml file found."

**Always `cd` into `visionspark/` before running any Flutter, Dart, or related commands.**

Example:
```
cd visionspark
flutter build apk --split-per-abi
```
