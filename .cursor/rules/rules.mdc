# Coding and Structure Rules

- Use PowerShell syntax for scripts and commands.
- Do not chain commands in scripts.
- Minimize code comments; keep code self-explanatory.
- Maintain clean, uniform code style throughout the project.
- Avoid files larger than ~300 lines; split large files into smaller modules when possible (exceptions allowed if necessary).
