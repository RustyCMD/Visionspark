# Coding Rules

- Use clean, self-explanatory code with minimal comments
- Keep files under ~300 lines when possible
- Maintain consistent coding style across the project
- All Flutter commands must be run from the [visionspark/](mdc:visionspark) directory (contains pubspec.yaml)
- Use Supabase MCP tools for backend/database operations
