# Feature Integration Planning

For new features (especially from [IMAGE_ENHANCEMENT_FEATURE.md](mdc:IMAGE_ENHANCEMENT_FEATURE.md)):

**Planning:**
- Break into actionable steps
- Identify required Supabase MCP tools
- Plan database migrations and edge function deployments
- Plan both backend (Supabase) and frontend (Flutter) integration

**Implementation:**
- Include error handling and validation
- Use version control for migrations and code changes
- Test thoroughly (unit, integration, end-to-end)
- Ensure backward compatibility and minimal downtime
- Document changes and update relevant rules

**Best Practices:**
- Use feature flags for risky changes
- Update [IMAGE_ENHANCEMENT_FEATURE.md](mdc:IMAGE_ENHANCEMENT_FEATURE.md) when features are completed
- Leverage all available Supabase MCP tools for seamless integration
