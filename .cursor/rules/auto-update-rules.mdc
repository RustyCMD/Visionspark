# Auto-Update Cursor Rules Guide

Whenever you make changes to the project structure, add, remove, or rename files or directories, or introduce new features or modules, you should update the relevant Cursor rules in the `.cursor/rules` directory. This ensures that the rules always accurately reflect the current state of the codebase and help with navigation and understanding.

- Update rules when:
  - New files or directories are added
  - Files or directories are removed or renamed
  - Significant changes are made to the structure or purpose of existing files
  - New features, modules, or migrations are introduced

Keep rules concise, accurate, and reference files using the `[filename.ext](mdc:filename.ext)` format as required by Cursor.
